# VPN configs

in this folder (on the actual server) live all the various VPN configs (ipsec, BGP and interface stuff).

*nothing* is checked into git by *design*:
1. `*.xml` files are the original AWS generated VPN config files -> these contain passwords and keys.
2. all `*.xml` can easily be re-generated by taining the Null-resource in terraform, see main howto for details
3. all other files are dynamically generated by `gen_configs.sh` which consumes the XML files and generates all other various configs based on trulia's template
